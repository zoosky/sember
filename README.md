# Sember

Sember is a one-file landing and CV page generator. A personal website generator if you will. One that takes away the choice of choosing a theme, modifying it or anything of that sort.

Sember makes some smart decisions for you based on the sember.edn file, such as whether to show you as employed somewhere or how to contact you, so you don't even have to mention any of this yourself.

## Install

You can grab the executable from the last build of each target.

**Linux (x86_64)**
